### jhood is a stock exhange market built for you 

We understand the temptation to sell when prices are low. So do all the other exchange markets, that's why they make their apps as addictive as possible. They thrive off constant buying and selling with no regard to what happens to you, the investor.

We do things a little differently at jHood. We want you to buy and sell, but never at the cost of you losing money. We firmly believe in the foundational principle of holding. True believers deserve a market place that reenforces proven strategy and not spur of the moment decision making.

jHood is the new way to invest smarter. See how jHood can maximize your profits today!
